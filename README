The purpose of the GeoNode Monitor is to provide admins of a GeoNode instance with reports on a GeoNode Instance they
administer. This is a simple django app embedded into the GeoNode base whose main purpose would be to log most of the 
events that occur within the GeoNode. This events for now will be limited to basic kinds of status requests. This
will provide users with the following information on their GeoNode.
           * Status on Broken Pages
           * Status on Broken Maps
           * Mail the admin on pages and maps that are broken
           * Check for Broken server and broken geonetwork
           * Return number of broken layers and maps
=======================================================================================================================
This now has support for checking broken layes. To check for broken layers add this to the maps management commands
and run 
django-admin.py layerstatus --settings=geonode.settings

Added a set up file to make installation easier and add it into the django installed apps
